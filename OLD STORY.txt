There once was a boy named Richard.
Richard was afraid of the dark.
One day he lost his way in a cavern.

He lost his flashlight just 10 seconds into his journey.
All he had left was his the light from his orb.
Luckily for Richard, he is afraid of the dark, not heights.

Richard was confident in his ability to jump...
...but sometimes falling is the better option.

Richard was afraid of what he'd find ahead.
Some of the passages felt man-made.

Richard was tired from all the jumping.
Richard explored the cavern, but found nothing useful.

Richard's nose caught the scent of fresh air.
He must be getting close...

Richard knew that this must be the last room.
His heart raced as he neared the exit.

The sun shone down on Richard.
He had made it out of the cave unharmed.
Richard no longer needed to fear the dark.
Thanks for playing!
